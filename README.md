# Web-page-Scrapping-using-Selenium-Python
WebScapping.py file: SASTRA result Web page Scrapping using Selenium and Python.\
It can be used to scrap web pages where you need to login with some ID and then scrap those data in it repeatedly.\
I used it to scrap Result(Mark) for all the students of my Department in SASTRA University.(for which I have to type each students ID login and then view the result).\
In that web page, they had Captcha (text not image). So, I copied and then pasted the captcha in text input box(programatically).\
So, I scraped all students data and printed it in console. If needed, it can be saved as csv file. 

GClassScrap.py file: Downlaod all files in the Google Classrooom - Classwork section\
It enables to download the files that you haven't downloaded before from google classroom
Instead of finding and downloading each and every file that you haven't donwloaded, you run this file and it will do it for you.
